//Q1: (Sum the digits in an integer) Write a program that reads an integer between 0 and 1000 and adds all
//     the digits in the integer. For example, if an integer is 932, the sum of all its digits is 14.
//     NOTE: We will need to solve this without using loops.
//     Hint: Use the % operator to extract digits, and use the / operator to remove the extracted digit. For instance, 932 % 10 = 2 and 932 / 10 = 93.
//     Here is a sample run:
//     Enter a number between 0 and 1000: 999
//     The sum of the digits is 27
